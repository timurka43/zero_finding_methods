    Finds the root in [1,2], which is the root furthest from initial guess.
    Method ignores the two roots that are closest to the initial guess.
    While this is not "ideal" behavior of the Newton's function, it is 
    understandable based of how it draws a tangent line using the first
    derivative and then uses that tangent line to approximate zero and 
    provide the next guess. This next guess ends up being closer to the 
    zero in the interval [1,2] and eventually finds it.

    All guesses seem to work.

    I implemented the Newton's method to always check the
    value of the function at the guess before calculating the value
    of the derivative function. Thus, even when the slope is zero,
    we do not get to the error message because that is also when 
    the value of the function is zero. 

    Plotting the function, we see that there are cases when the value 
    of the derivative is zero, but the value of the funciton is not zero. 
    Thus, if we were to come across such a point with our value of the derivative, 
    the method would throw an error at us. However, neither of the cases above 
    cause this to happen.

    the second guess in part a is -2, which produces a complex number once plugged into the f'(x)
    since f'(x) includes the term x**1/3. As such, the function cannot continue generating as it
    is not designed to work with complex numbers.

    I implemented the Newton's method so it provides a helpful message without
    throwing an error.
