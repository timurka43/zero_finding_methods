Title: Homework 1, part 3. SIR Model
Author: Timur Kasimov (Grinnell, 2025)
Data Created: February, 2024
Date Updated: February 13, 2024

Purpose: Estimate the peak of the I (infectious) curve in the SIR Model

This is a homework assignment for my Computational Methods Class

'''
In order to find the maximum of the curve I, we need to find where its first 
derivative is zero.
Need to define the two functions you will feed to your newton method
'''


def dIdt(init, t, R0):  
    ##need to calculate S(t) and I(t) first
    St, It, Rt = sir(init, t, R0)
    ## then use formula for dIdt: R0SI - I
    return R0*St*It - It

    

def d2Idt2(init, t, R0):
    ##need to calculate S(t) and I(t) first
    St, It, Rt = sir(init, t, R0)
    ## then use formula for d2Idt2:
    return -(R0*R0)*St*(It*It) + ((R0*St-1)**2)*It

'''
Rewrite Newton's method now so it takes in init vector and R0 as parameters.
The new method does not need to take f(x) and df(x) since these functions are
predefined for the netwon approach to sir simulation specifically. Just have newton_sir
use these two functions without having to take them in as parameters.

Instead, the method takes the initialized vector with S, I, R values,
R0 constant, and the initial guess t (guessed time of the peak).
