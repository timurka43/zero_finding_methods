# zero_finding_methods
A project with 3 zero finding methods (Bisection, Newton, Secant)

Each method takes in a function and its derivative and finds the point at which the function is equal to zero.

# Bisection
Bisection method takes in two points, one at which the function is negative and one at which the function is 
positive, cuts the domain in half by finding the midpoint, and repeats the process for the positive/negative 
value of the function at midpoint and the left or right initial point that has the opposite sign.
